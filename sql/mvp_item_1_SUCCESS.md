# MVP Item #1 - SUCCESS ‚úÖ

## Objective
Swap the leaderboard to read from `score_entries` filtered to the latest run.

## Status
**COMPLETED** - SQL executed successfully on [DATE]

## SQL Executed
File: `sql/mvp_item_1_leaderboard_swap_FINAL_v3.sql`

### What Was Changed
- `leaderboard_overall_latest_v1` view now filters to users in latest score run
- Reads from `observations` table (preserves all metrics)
- Filters to only users who appear in latest `score_entries` run
- Materialized view refreshed successfully

### Column Structure (Preserved)
1. `user_login` (text)
2. `obs_count` (bigint)
3. `distinct_taxa` (bigint)
4. `first_observed_at` (timestamp with time zone)
5. `last_observed_at` (timestamp with time zone)

## Verification

### Current State
- ‚úÖ View updated successfully
- ‚úÖ Materialized view refreshed
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Latest run has 0 students (expected if scoring hasn't run yet)

### Check Data Population

```sql
-- Check if there are any score runs
SELECT
  id,
  started_at,
  ended_at,
  ingested_count
FROM public.score_runs
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check if there are any score entries
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_score_entries
FROM public.score_entries;

-- Check if there are any observations
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_observations
FROM public.observations;

-- Check current leaderboard state
SELECT *
FROM public.leaderboard_overall_mv
ORDER BY obs_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Next Steps

### When Scoring Runs
1. Ingestion workflow will populate `score_entries`
2. Leaderboard will automatically filter to latest run users
3. MV refresh step in workflow will update the materialized view

### GitHub Workflow
**No changes needed** - The existing workflow step already refreshes the MV:
```yaml
- name: "Refresh leaderboard MV"
  run: |
    curl -sS -X POST \
      -H "apikey: $SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      "$SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/rpc/refresh_leaderboard_overall_mv"
```

## Testing

### Manual Test (Once Data Exists)
1. Run the ingestion workflow to populate score_entries
2. Verify leaderboard shows only users from latest run
3. Confirm MV refresh completes successfully

### Expected Behavior
- Leaderboard will show only users who have entries in the latest score run
- All metrics (obs_count, distinct_taxa, timestamps) will be calculated from observations
- Users not in latest run will be filtered out

## Rollback (If Needed)

To restore original behavior (show all users):

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.leaderboard_overall_latest_v1 AS
SELECT
  user_login,
  COUNT(*)::bigint AS obs_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT taxon_id)::bigint AS distinct_taxa,
  MIN(observed_at) AS first_observed_at,
  MAX(observed_at) AS last_observed_at
FROM public.observations
WHERE user_login IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY user_login;

REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY public.leaderboard_overall_mv;
```

## Files Modified
- ‚úÖ `sql/mvp_item_1_leaderboard_swap_FINAL_v3.sql` - Final working version
- üìÑ `sql/mvp_item_1_leaderboard_swap_FINAL_v2.sql` - Outdated (column order)
- üìÑ `sql/mvp_item_1_leaderboard_swap_FINAL.sql` - Outdated (column names)
- üìÑ `sql/mvp_item_1_leaderboard_swap_CORRECTED.sql` - Outdated (join issues)
- üìÑ `sql/mvp_item_1_leaderboard_swap.sql` - Original (wrong schema)

## Summary
